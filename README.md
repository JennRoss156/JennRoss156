- 👋 Hi, I’m @JennRoss156
- 👀 I’m interested in building computers and working from the command line. I like to 
repair what others think is broken. Currently I have a wiped Mac OS that I've been trying 
to reinstall the OS on from the terminal but I keep getting command not found. It's running 
bash 3.2 and I have a windows keyboard but that's not a problem. It's the command not found 
Issue and it wanting an Apple ID to reinstall via the recovery method. Please help.
- 🌱 I’m currently in school seeking a bachelor's in computer science and information technology.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything.
