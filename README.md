- 👋 Hi, I’m @JennRoss156
- 👀 I’m interested in building computers and working from the command line. I like to 
repair what others think is broken. I enjoy coding and figuring out how the program language talks
to the computer and other services. Currently, I am working with Growic's platform to 
to become a Solidity Developer. This is new to me but so far, enjoyable. Just boaught a domain
and will be sharing code very soon. I hope to become a stellar developer for both front-end & back-end developemnt.
- 🌱 Bachelor's in computer science in information technology with a special interest in website development.
      Master's degree in Science of Information Technology with special interest in Software Development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with others to learn tips & tricks of the trade. One day I plan to work for Google, Facebook, or Microsoft.
- 📫 How to reach me is by email jennross436@gmail.com; jenniferross156@alumni.ctuonline.edu.
