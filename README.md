- 👋 Hi, I’m @JennRoss156
- 👀 I’m interested in building computers and working from the command line. I like to 
repair what others think is broken. I enjoy coding and figuring out how the program language talks
to the computer and other services.Currently I have a wiped Mac OS that I've been trying 
to reinstall the OS on from the terminal but I keep getting command not found. It's running 
bash 3.2 and I have a windows keyboard. It's the command not found issue. Just boaught a domain
and will be sharing code very soon. I enjoy my job a Blackboard and hope to some day work on the LMS coding.
- 🌱 Bachelor's in computer science in information technology with a special interest in website development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything.
